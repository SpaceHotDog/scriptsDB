EXAMPLE:
--------

CREATE EVENT myevent
    ON SCHEDULE AT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP + INTERVAL 1 HOUR
    DO
      UPDATE myschema.mytable SET mycol = mycol + 1;


The previous statement creates an event named myevent. This event executes once — one hour following its creation — by running an SQL statement that increments the value of the myschema.mytable table's mycol column by 1.
